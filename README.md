# Hi there! üëã I'm Shahzeb Umer

I'm a passionate Software Engineer and Computer Science student, currently pursuing my Bachelor's at NUCES - FAST (_Expected_ 2025). I specialize in Full-Stack Development, and DevOps, I'm always excited to dive into new technologies.

In my projects, I combine creativity with technical skills to build efficient, scalable, and user-friendly applications. I have experience working with a variety of frameworks and tools like React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Kubernetes, and AWS, and I'm always learning and experimenting with new concepts.

Feel free to explore my repositories, and if you have any questions or want to collaborate, don't hesitate to reach out!

### 1. [Are We Making DevOps Complicated? The Case of Simplicity in Tooling](https://medium.com/@umershahzeb/are-we-making-devops-complicated-the-case-of-simplicity-in-tooling-54b5878b5d8a)
This was in the start of the course. Getting to know alot of technologies overwhemled me and decided to write about that for my first article. In this article, I explore the balance between the complexity and power of modern DevOps tools. While these tools offer flexibility, they can also create tool sprawl, increased overhead, and hinder productivity. The article advocates for a minimalist approach in tooling to streamline DevOps practices, enhance collaboration, and foster continuous improvement.

This guide dives deep into the architecture and configuration of Prometheus, a powerful monitoring system for distributed systems. It covers how to configure Prometheus for effective monitoring, alerting, and scaling, ensuring that organizations can maintain healthy system performance and gain valuable insights.

### 3. [Understanding Terraform: A Comprehensive Guide to Infrastructure Automation](https://medium.com/@umershahzeb/understanding-terraform-a-comprehensive-guide-to-infrastructure-automation-65f741c0762c)
